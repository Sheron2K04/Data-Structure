Overview
This project contains a Java program demonstrating the use of collections in Java. The file CollectionPractical1.java showcases the practical implementation of various collection types such as ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap, and demonstrates how to manipulate and iterate through these collections.

Features
ArrayList: Demonstrates dynamic arrays for storing a list of elements.
HashSet: Illustrates the use of sets to store unique elements.
HashMap: Provides a map implementation for key-value pairs.
Iteration through collections using loops and iterators.
